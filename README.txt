Safe Jourmey Suitcase

this is a project for my senior project at NDU-NLC, it is about a suitcase with a few sensors to check if it was open as well as find it in case it is lost.
in this repository, there is a report for the project, as well as the files for the arduino and flutter (mobile app).

in each folder there is a readme correspondingly.
